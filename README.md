## Problem Description:

The given problem is to create a database for an owner of a football team that models the entities and relationships that exist. We decided to improve the model by portraying the entities and relationships of an entire football league. The central entity of the model is Team, which represents each of the competing teams in our league. The team entity is then related to the players on the roster, the staff that works for them, the fans that cheer for them, their financial situation, and the results of each game they play in. Furthermore, we are looking to expand on the game entity by connecting it to entities that record player statistics within a game, injuries that occur, and the amount of games within a given season. Finally, we are including an awards entity to capture the best players from a given season. Our goal is to accurately model the relationships between these entities, insert sample data into each entity, and execute functioning queries in order to provide us with valuable information about our created football league.
## Data Model:

Explanation of Data Model:
Our model is based on the structure of a created football league. The central entity, Team, includes information about the name of the team and where it is located. Within each team, there are many players, staff members, and fans, which explains the many to many relationships that exist between Team and the Player, Staff and Fan entities. Within the player entity, we capture the name, date of birth, and position of each individual. Within the staff entity, we include information on their name, job position, and salary. Furthermore, we implemented a recursive relationship within the staff entity in order to define who is the respective boss of each of the staff members. The fan entity includes information on their name, contact info, and season ticket status. 

Additionally, each team has different types of financial transactions theyâ€™re related to, which is why we created a one to many relationship between Team and Financials. The Financials entity includes other information such as the type of transaction, the amount, and the date that it takes place. The final relationship that takes place with the team entity is between Team and Game. Each team plays in many games which lead to using a many to many relationship to connect the entities. This relationship allows us to record which teams are playing in each game, what season it is taking place in, and the outcome of the game.

The Game entity has three other branches coming off of it, connecting to entities representing Statistics, Injuries, and Season. Within each game, there are many different statistics that can be recorded, however, a player can only record one of each type of statistic in a given game, leading to a one to one relationship. The statistics entity also records the type of statistic being logged, the value of the statistic, and which player the statistic correlates too. Similarly, there are many different injuries that can take place within a single game. Unlike statistics, it is possible for a player to have the same injury twice in a given game, leading to another one to many relationship. The Injuries entity records information on what type of injury occurred, to which player, and which game. The final branch that comes out of the game entity is in relation to the season entity. Although a season has many games, each game is identified by a unique number, making it impossible to have a repeating game ID. This means that the relationship between the two entities is one to one. Furthermore, we included information in the Season entity to capture the start and end dates of the given season.

The final relationships that take place within our model involve the Awards entity. The awards entity has a one to many relationship with season, since there are a number of different awards that are given out on any given season. The awards entity contains information on the name of the award, which player won the award, and in which season it was awarded. The other branch that Awards is related to is Player. Since it is impossible for a player to win the same award twice in the same season, a one to one relationship is used.

## Queries:

<img width="653" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 5 35 39 PM" src="https://github.com/aja1232/4610-Project-1/assets/148247965/3eee5a70-2ad5-4415-8ae0-62d6a6c82e0f">

1. This query selects the first and last name, team name, type of statistics and total for amount for statistics of the type YDS. The results are grouped by player name, team name, and statistics type. This could be used to compare total yardages each player has accumulated and enable the highest performers to be easily identified.

2. This query selects the name and winning percentage of a team with a certain ID. This could be useful to quickly calculate what percentage of a team's games result in wins, and determine whether a team is having a good season.

3. Query 3 selects the name of each employee and the person they report to. This could be used to see which boss is responsible for each employee. For example, if someone wanted to get scouting information to Coach Kirby Smart, they would have to go through Bobby Boucher, who is an employee of Coach Smart.

4. This selects all staff members who have a salary greater than the average salary for all staff on any team. It also lists the team they work for and their salary. This could be used to determine who the highest paid employees in the league are, which may be a useful indicator of team performance.

5. This selects the team name, transaction type, and amount of financial transactions that are less than the average transaction for all teams. This could be used to quickly identify the types of transactions that are lower than the average amount and therefore may not be providing good value to teams.

6. This query lists the team name and player name of every player that has Defensive Back (DB) listed as their position. This utilizes multiple joins and the use of regular expression. This query would be useful in a situation where a DB on a certain team was injured, or not playing well. This allows all DBs to be quickly listed and could help a team find players to try to acquire.

7. This query displays the first and last name of fans that have allegiance to the Georgia Bulldogs. This query utilizes a multiple table join, group by, and regexp. This would be useful when trying to determine what fans have allegiance to the Georgia bulldogs. For example, if you were trying to send new season ticket promotions to Georgia fans, you would need to know which fans had allegiance to Georgia.

8. This query lists the names of every player that has received an award and the name of the award. This utilizes a subquery, as well as â€˜existsâ€™ in order to only list the names of players who have received an award, and leaves out all the players who have not received any awards. This would be useful if one was trying to argue which player was the greatest of all time because they would need to pull up that playerâ€™s awards.

9. This selects the name of players who have been injured more than once as well as the type of injury they received. This is useful because If a player has received multiple injuries, especially concussions, they may need to stop playing in order to avoid long term consequences. Team doctors would need this information in order to find players that were at risk to re-injure themselves.

10. This query selects the number of fans who hold season tickets for each team. This is useful to assess which teams are the most successful at selling their season ticket packages, and can indicate which teams have the most overall fans.
